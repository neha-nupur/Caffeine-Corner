# Caffeine-Corner

This is a simple HTML, CSS and Javascript website for Caffeine Corner, a coffee shop. This website has different sections such as the header, home, about, menu, cart, etc. that are briefly described below.

## Sections

### Header

The header section contains the logo of Caffeine Corner, a navigation bar with different links, a search button, a shopping cart icon, and a menu icon. The search button and shopping cart icon are linked with a search-form and cart-items-container respectively, which are not visible until an icon is clicked.

## Navigation Bar

The navigation bar has a button with an ID "#menu-btn". When the user clicks this button, the `.active` class is toggled on the navbar, which shows/hides the navigation menu. Similarly, there is another button with the ID "#search-btn" that toggles the `.active` class on another div, `search-form`. There is also a cart button with the ID "#cart-btn" that toggles the `.active` class on another div called "cart-items-container".

When the user scrolls down the page, all three classes ("active" on navbar, search-form, and cart-items-container) are removed to avoid hiding content and blocking user navigation.

### Home

The home section is the first part of the website. It contains the tagline of the coffee shop, a brief description, and a call-to-action button for ordering.

### About

The about section describes the Caffeine Corner Coffee shop. It talks about the quality of coffee, its sources, and the uniqueness. This section also has a learn more button for more details.

### Menu

This section displays the list of different types of coffee available at the shop. For each coffee type, an image, name, price, and "add to cart" button are provided. The add to cart button doesn't have any functionality.

### Cart

The cart section currently is part of the header, where the shopping cart icon toggles the visibility of the cart items container. The container shows four items with their names, images, and prices. It also has a checkout button, which is also not functional.

## Links and References

This website also uses some external content such as Font Awesome's CSS and images. The source and links are mentioned in the header section.

## Products Section

The products section showcases some of the Caffeine Corner's products with their images, name, price, and rating. Each product has three icons, namely, shopping cart, heart, and eye, which are not functional. The section is aligned in a box-container with three boxes and some spacing between them.


## Review Section

The review section displays the comments and ratings of some of the customers of Caffeine Corner. Each customer's review is shown in a box that consists of a quote icon at the top, followed by the review, customer's image, name, and rating. There are three such boxes in the section.


## Blogs Section

The blogs section shows three different blogs related to coffee. Each blog consists of an image, a title, publication date, and a short description. The read more button redirects the user to the whole article on another page.


## Contact Section

The contact section allows the user to get in touch with the coffee shop by placing their name, email, phone number in the input boxes provided. There is also a map showing the location of the coffee shop right next to the input form.


## Footer Section

The footer section includes social media links (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Pinterest) for the coffee shop. It also includes links to different sections of the website (Home, About, Menu, Products, Review, Blogs, and Contact). At the bottom, there is a message that says the website is created by Neha Nupur and All Right Reserved.
